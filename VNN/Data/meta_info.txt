## Set3
Set 3 aims to test whether an unimportant gene that is assigned to a module
will have the weight connecting it to the module correctly go to 0. Gene1, 
gene2, and gene3 are all considered a part of GO:01 initially, but the 
function that generates the data is f(x) = x[1] + x[2]. Therefore, gene3
has no contribution to the output, and its weight connecting it to GO:01 
should go to 0. 

For model3, there is exactly 1 neuron in the GO:01 module layer, and 
there are no bias weights in the network at all.
